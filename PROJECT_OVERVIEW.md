# Terra Trionfo - Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Summary

Terra Trionfo is a **production-ready farm-to-table marketplace** built for Trionfo Holding Co., Inc. The platform enables artisan producers to sell through two distinct business models:

1. **Marketplace Model**: Vendors list products and set prices (Terra Trionfo takes commission)
2. **Wholesale Model**: Terra Trionfo purchases inventory and manages retail pricing

A single vendor can use both models for different products, providing maximum flexibility.

## 💰 Pricing Logic

### Pricing Logic
For all products the `retailPriceCents` field holds the final price.
- Marketplace listings: price set by vendor, markup applied behind-the-scenes
- Wholesale listings: admin/terra sets the price directly
- Hybrid: either mechanism may determine the price per requirement

`unitPrice` computed as `retailPriceCents / 100` in orders.

### Wholesale Product
```typescript
if (product.isWholesale) {
  wholesaleCost = 10.00   // What Terra pays vendor
  consumerPrice = 30.00   // Set by Terra/Admin
  margin = 20.00          // Terra's profit
}
```

### Hybrid Product
```typescript
if (product.isMarketplace && product.isWholesale) {
  // Both models available
  // Different pricing for each
  // Flexible choice per transaction
}
```
